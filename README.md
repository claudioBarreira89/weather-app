# Starting the App

Run npm i, then npm start

The App will be available in http://localhost:8080/

# Weather API

The API was retrieving CORS errors, so I had to use https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ to enable cross-origin requests

The API returns six weather results, current day plus the following five days. For the porpuse of this exercise, and to better align with the mock provided, I only considered the first five results
